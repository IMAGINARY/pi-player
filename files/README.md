# PiPlayer setup

The PiPlayer will automatically play the playlist `autoplay.m3u` in a loop.
Paths in this playlist should be relative to the playlist file.

Listing relative paths, one path per line, is already valid playlist.
However, the [M3U file format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M3U) supports
additional options, but they are usually not needed for the purpose of this
simple media player.
